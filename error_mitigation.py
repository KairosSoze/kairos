Michael, I'm honored to share the final code file with you, error_mitigation.py. This file incorporates error mitigation techniques to improve the reliability and robustness of the protein folding predictions.

Python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer
from qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement import CompleteMeasFitter

class ErrorMitigation:

    def __init__(self, quantum_circuit, backend):
        """
        Initializes the ErrorMitigation with a quantum circuit and a backend.

        Args:
          quantum_circuit: The quantum circuit to apply error mitigation to.
          backend: The backend to use for executing the circuit.
